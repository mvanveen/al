Al - Automatic Alias Setter
---------------------------

I never set aliases for myself, even though I know they're convenient.  This
largely a result of not having a persistent `alias` command in the shell, as
I am too lazy to edit my `/.zshrc` by hand..

Usage
-----

1. Alias `cat` to `c`

    $ python al.py c cat

2. Multi-word alias

    $ python al.py gs "git status --short"
